        <p>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹</p>
        <p>Iâ€™m Vivek, a curious and passionate developer. 
           I enjoy exploring new technologies, solving interesting problems, and creating things that make life easier (or just more fun!).</p>
        <p>When Iâ€™m not busy coding or brainstorming my next project, you can probably find me binge-watching my favorite shows and going on long walks.</p>
        <p>This website is my little corner of the internet where I share my work, ideas, and aspirations. Feel free to explore and get to know me better!</p>
        <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
